##The App

Its easy to go to Amazon and search for a book when you know what your looking for, but what do you do when you just want to expand your knowledge? "Moar Learn" is a book recommendation engine which answers that question.

You can type in the name of a topic you know and love, then "Moar Learn" will suggest some related topics that you might enjoy learning "moar" about. After you pick a topic, the app will recommend books on the topic, which are available on Amazon.

Alternatively, you can enter a URL and "Moar Learn" will identify the topic of the site, suggest the topic and related topics for reading, then recommend books based on the topic you select.

I hope you enjoy discovering new things to read and learn about!
