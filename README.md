##The Challenge
- **[TopCoder Open 2014 Mashathon](http://community.topcoder.com/tco14/developer-events/win-at-tco14/#winMashathon)**

##APIs Used
- **[HP IDOL OnDemand](http://www.idolondemand.com/)**

##Also Used

##The App

The "Moar Learn" app is very simple. It asks the user to input a topic that they like, then uses the HP IDOL OnDemand API to suggest related topics. The user can then pick a related topic that they are interested in learning "moar" about, and the app will use the Amazon Product Advertising API to suggest some books on the topic so that the user can learn "moar"!
